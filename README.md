## Installation

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies:

   - `ox_target` (optional but recommended)

2. Download and place the script in your resources folder

3. Add to your `server.cfg`:
   ```
   ensure lspd_ai_callouts
   ```

4. Configure the script by editing `config.lua`

## Configuration

### Basic Settings
```lua
Config.PoliceJob = 'police' -- Set to false for standalone
Config.UseOxTarget = true   -- Enable ox_target integration
Config.Debug = false        -- Enable debug logging
```

### Callout Frequency
```lua
Config.CalloutFrequency = {
    min = 120000, -- 2 minutes minimum
    max = 300000  -- 5 minutes maximum
}
```

### Crime Type Weights
Adjust the probability of different crime types:
```lua
Config.CrimeTypes = {
    robbery = { weight = 25, priority = 'High' },
    pursuit = { weight = 20, priority = 'High' },
    -- ... etc
}
```

## Commands

### Player Commands
- `/duty` - Toggle police duty status
- `/backup [reason]` - Request backup assistance
- `/callouts` - View active callouts menu
- `/policetools` - Access police tools menu

### Admin Commands
- `/callout [type]` - Manually create a test callout

## Key Bindings

- **F6** - Toggle Police Duty

## How It Works

### Automatic Callout Generation
- System monitors on-duty officers

1. **Order Weapon Drop** - Command armed suspects to disarm
2. **Arrest** - Place suspect in custody
3. **Search** - Pat down for contraband
